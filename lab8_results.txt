Question 1 Answer:
 The plot (sales_plot.png) shows a strong upward trend in sales from 1985 to 2019.
 No seasonal component exists due to annual data.
 Cyclical patterns are visible (e.g., dips around 1994, 2004, 2011), possibly due to economic cycles.
 Irregular components appear as short-term fluctuations around the trend.
 
Question 2 Answer:
 Regression results: Intercept = 0.402, Slope = 4.296, RÂ² = 0.980.
 Residual plots (residual_plots.png, residuals_vs_time.png) show a pattern in residuals vs. time,
 with positive residuals early and late, negative in the middle, suggesting autocorrelation.
 Q-Q plot shows slight deviations from normality at the tails.
 Residuals vs. fitted show no clear heteroscedasticity.
 ZINE assumptions are violated due to autocorrelation.
 
Question 3 Answer:
 DW statistic = 0.821, p-value = 0.000.
 Since p < 0.05, there is evidence of positive first-order autocorrelation.
 
Question 4 Answer:
 The regression assumes independent errors (ZINE's Independence).
 The DW test (DW < 2, p < 0.05) indicates first-order autocorrelation,
 violating this assumption. This leads to biased standard errors,
 unreliable t-tests, and inefficient estimates.
 
Question 5 Answer:
 I recommend a regression model (Sales = b0 + b1T) with first-order autocorrelation
 correction using GLS with an AR(1) error structure, implemented via nlme::gls.
 
Question 6 Answer:
 Simple OLS: Intercept = 0.402, SE = 2.206; Slope = 4.296, SE = 0.107.
 GLS with AR(1): Intercept = 0.405, SE = 3.812; Slope = 4.296, SE = 0.181.
 Intercept changed by 0.004, SE increased. Slope changed by 0.000, SE increased.
 GLS provides more reliable estimates by accounting for autocorrelation.
